  A perfect match for anyone who is feeling particularly lazy but needs a really
  good excuse. Maybe you have a friend who is always late and you're forever
  joking about how they stay in bed too late, hence the energy efficiency.


  People can be quite lazy but actually this puts a bit of a spin on things
  because they're not really lazy they are energy efficient people and they
  could teach us a thing or two.


  The beautiful quote puts together these designs for people who love quote
  t-shirts, we all know someone who's a bit lazy and this is the perfect gift
  for them. Some people just like to sit all day, or even sit and play their
  game console for the entire night, they aren't being lazy according to them,
  they are just reserving energy.
