  This bold statement will ring true to many travellers ears. This is for people
  who really appreciate the people around them and the places they visit yet
  know for sure that there is beauty and love everywhere they go and all the
  places they haven't yet been.  This t-shirt is for those that love to travel
  and those that already know what they love, the cities and the people. Ideal
  for people to love adventure and meeting new people from across the world.


  This beautiful quote is what all wanderlust people can agree on. People that
  appreciate the world also love every aspect if it including the people and the
  many places around them.


  I'm in love with the cities I've never been and the people I've never met is
  the perfect quote t-shirt for anyone that loves to travel, to see the world
  and to have a connection with the places and people they meet.
